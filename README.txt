KickBall-Website
================

This program explores at how we can make our web pages dynamic by creating 
HTML on the fly using Ruby and ERB templates.


I have been commissioned by the premier League of Cool Kickball Professionals (LACKP) to build their first website.
The league currently has 4 teams. The league has supplied a CSV of the players.

This program then reads in the CSV file and passes on relevant information according to HTTP requests to the
various .erb files.

NOTE: the instructions to run the program and see output on web browser are in the header comments of "server.rb" 
which is the main file.
